Checklist module
================

**Introduction**
This is a Moodle plugin for Moodle 1.9 & 2.0+ that allows a teacher to create a checklist for their students to work through.
The teacher can monitor all the student's progress, as they tick off each of the items in the list.
Note: There are separate downloads for the Moodle 1.9 and 2.0+ versions of this plugin - make sure you download the correct version.

Items can be indented and marked as optional.
Students are presented with a simple chart showing how far they have progressed through the required/optional items and can add their own, private, items to the list.

**Installation**
Unzip the contents of file you downloaded to a temporary folder.
Upload the files to the your moodle server, placing them in the 'moodle/mod/checklist' folder.
Log in as administrator and click on 'Notifications' in the admin area to update the Moodle database, ready to use this plugin.

**Usage**
Click on 'Add an activity' and choose 'Checklist'.
Enter all the usual information.
You can optionally allow students to add their own, private items to the list (this will not affect the overall progress, but may help students to keep note of anything extra they need to do).

You can then add items to the list.
Click on the 'star' to toggle an item between required & optional (I intend this to interact with the Moodle 2.0 'completion' tracking at some point).
Click on the 'edit' icon to change the text.
Click on the 'indent' icons to change the level of indent.
Click on the 'move' icons to move the item up/down one place.
Click on the 'delete' icon to delete the item.
Click on the '+' icon to insert a new item immediately below the current item.

Click on 'Preview', to get some idea of how this will look to students.
Click on 'Results', to see a chart of how the students are currently progressing through the checklist.

Students can now log in, click on the checklist, tick any items they have completed and then click 'Save' to update the database.
If you have allowed them to do so, they can click on 'Start Adding Items', then click on the green '+' icons to insert their own, private items to the list.

If you allow a checklist to be updated by teachers (either exclusively, or in addition to students), it can be updated by doing the following:
1. Click 'Results'
2. Click on the little 'Magnifying glass' icon, beside the student's name
3. Choose Yes / No for each item
4. Click 'Save'
5. (Optional) Click 'Add comments', enter/update/delete a comment against each item, Click 'Save'
5. Click 'View all Progress' to go back to the view with all the students shown.
