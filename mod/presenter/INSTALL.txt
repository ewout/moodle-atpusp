Requirements
-----------------
The import functionality needs 'xmlreader' in order to function properly. Please make sure that 'xmlreader' is enabled on your server.
Please make sure you have the 'php_zip' extension enabled. If it is disabled the presenter mod will try to run linux shell commands with exec to zip/unzip.


New install
-----------
Put the folder presenter inside your /moodle/mod directory. 

Put the lang files, from /lang directory to the corresponding /moodle/lang directories, for each lang. 

From the admin page, click on the 'Notifications' link (it's in the left side) - all the tables required for this module
will be created and the module will be installed.



Update from an older version of Moodle Pesenter
--------------------------------------------------
Simply overwrite the files in the /moodle/mod/presenter directory with the new files. 

Overwrite the lang files from /moodle/lang directory with the corespoding file from the /lang directory.

All your old settings will be preserved.
