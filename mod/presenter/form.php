ADDITIONAL TERM per GPL Section 7 for Flowplayer
If you convey this program (or any modifications of it) and assume contractual liability for the program to recipients of it, you agree to
indemnify Flowplayer, Ltd. for any liability that those contractual assumptions impose on Flowplayer, Ltd.

Except as expressly provided herein, no trademark rights are granted in any trademarks of Flowplayer, Ltd. Licensees are granted a limited,
non-exclusive right to use the mark Flowplayer and the Flowplayer logos in connection with unmodified copies of the Program and the copyright
notices required by section 5.d of the GPL license. For the purposes of this limited trademark license grant, customizing the Flowplayer by
skinning, scripting, or including PlugIns provided by Flowplayer, Ltd. is not considered modifying the Program.

Licensees that do modify the Program, taking advantage of the open-source license, may not use the Flowplayer mark or Flowplayer logos and must
change the fullscreen notice (and the non-fullscreen notice, if that option is enabled), the copyright notice in the dialog box, and the notice
on the Canvas as follows:

the full screen (and non-fullscreen equivalent, if activated) noticeshould read: "Based on Flowplayer source code"; in the context menu
(right-click menu), the link to "About Flowplayer free version #.#.#" can remain. The copyright notice can remain, but must be supplemented
with an additional notice, stating that the licensee modified the Flowplayer. A suitable notice might read
"Flowplayer Source code modified by ModOrg 2009"; for the canvas, the notice should read "Based on Flowplayer source code".
In addition, licensees that modify the Program must give the modified Program a new name that is not confusingly similar to Flowplayer
and may not distribute it under the name Flowplayer.
