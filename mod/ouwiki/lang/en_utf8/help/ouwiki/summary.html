<h1>Wiki</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
If you enter a summary it will appear on the start page of the wiki. The summary appears
above the normal, editable wiki text and cannot itself be edited by users.
</p>

<p>
Summaries are entirely optional and your wiki may not need one. If you don't need a 
summary, just leave the box blank.
