<h1>Wiki</h1>

<h2>Sub-wikis</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Single wiki for course</strong><br />
This wiki behaves as one single wiki. Everybody on the course sees the same pages.</li>
<li><strong>One wiki per group</strong><br />
Members of each group see an entirely separate copy of the wiki (sub-wiki) specific to their 
group. You can only see pages created by people in the same group. If you are in  
more than one group, or you have permissions that allow you to view all groups,
you get a dropdown to choose a group.</li>
<li><strong>Separate wiki for every user</strong><br />
Every single user gets an entirely different wiki. You can only see your own wiki unless
you have permissions that allow you to view others, when you get a dropdown to choose
a user. (This can be used as a way for students to contribute work, although you should
consider other ways to achieve this such as the Assessment activity.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that the group option works with the chosen grouping. It will ignore groups in other
groupings.
