<h1>Set Mail Notification</h1>
<p>This option controls whether notification messages are sent. If this
   option is set to &quot;Yes&quot; a short email is sent to the recipient 
   of a new entry. The email message does not contain the text of the entry,
   simply a sentence to say a new entry has been added and a link to the 
   dialogue.</p>

<p>Note this option applies to all the dialogues active in the dialogue 
    instance. The option can be changed at anytime.</p>
