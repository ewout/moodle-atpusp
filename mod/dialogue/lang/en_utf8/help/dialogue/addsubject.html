<h1>Adding Subjects</h1>

<p>You can use this link to add a Subject to the dialogue. It's a 
    good idea to always have a subject for the dialogue, it keeps 
    the dialogue on track and focuses the replies on the topic. 
    If you want to start talking about another subject it is 
    better to close the current dialogue and start a new dialogue 
    on that topic.</p>
