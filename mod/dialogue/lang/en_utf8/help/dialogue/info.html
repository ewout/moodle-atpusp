<img alt="" src="<?php echo $CFG->wwwroot?>/mod/dialogue/icon.gif" />&nbsp;<b>Dialogues</b></p>

<p>This module provides a simple communication method between pairs of users.
    A teacher can open an dialogue with a student, a student can open
    a dialogue with a teacher, and (optionally) a student can open a 
    dialogue with another student. A teacher or student can be involved 
    in many on-going dialogues at any time.</p>

<p>A dialogue can have an unlimited number of entries, normally the 
    &quot;conversation&quot; takes place as a set of interleaved
    replies. This format is not enforced and either party can add to the
    dialogue at any time.</p>

<p>A dialogue can be closed by either party at any time. Closed dialogues
    cannot be reopened. However, a closed
    dialogue can be viewed by either party provided it is still in existence... </p>
    
<p>...The module deletes closed dialogues and all their entries after a 
    certain time. That time is set here when the Dialogue is created.</p>

<p>If the course has groups the following points apply.
<ul><li>When opening a new dialogue the teacher is shown the group mode of the 
    dialogue and their current group. This information is displayed immediately
    below the Tab Bar.</li>
<li>A teacher can start dialogues with all the students in their current group 
    by choosing the group name in the drop-down list of names. Once started 
    the dialogues operate in the normal way, that is, they are one-to-one 
    dialogues between the teacher and individual students.</li>
<li>If the dialogue is in SEPARATE GROUPS mode then students only see other
    students in their own group (assuming the dialogue allows student-to-student
    dialogues). In this mode students who are not in any group do not see any 
    other students.</li>
</ul>
