<h1>Closing Dialogues</h1>
<p>You can close a dialogue at any time. Closing a dialogue
    stops the dialogue and removes it from your current list of dialogues. That is,
    closed dialogues do not appear on this page. </p>

<p>You will be able to view closed dialogues but you can not add to them.
    However, closed dialogues may be deleted if you have updated the dialogue
    and set a period other than zero days for dialogue deletions. After that point they 
    obviously will not be available even for viewing.</p>
    
<p>If you do close this dialogue, then you will have to start a new dialogue
    if you want to continue to &quot;talk&quot; with this person. That person
    will re-appear in the list of people you can start dialogues with.</p>
