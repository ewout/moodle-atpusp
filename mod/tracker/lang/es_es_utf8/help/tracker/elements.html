<h3>Elements</h3>
<p>
Issue submission form can be customized by adding form elements. The "summary", "description", et "reportedby" fields are as default, but any additional qualifier can be added to the issue description.
</p>
<p>
Elements that can be added are "form elements" i.e. standard form widgets that can represent any qualifier or open description, such as radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown, textfields or textareas.
</p>
<p>Elements are set using the following properties:
</p>
<h3>A name</h3>
<p>This name is the element identifier, technically speaking. It must be a token using alphanumeric chars and the _ character, without spaces or non printable chars. The name will not appear on the user interface.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The description is used when the element has to be identified on the user interface.</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p>Some elements have a finite list of option values.
</p>
<p>Options are added after the element is created.</p>
<p>Fieldtexts and textareas do not have any options.</p>
