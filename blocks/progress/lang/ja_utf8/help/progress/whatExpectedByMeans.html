<h1>What does Expected By Mean?</h1>

<p>The <em>expected by</em> date-time is independant of any date or time in the configuration of an activity or resource. When you initially create a new activity or resource and visit the configuration page of the Progress Bar block it will attempt to guess an appropriate <em>expected by</em> date-time based on dates in the module's configuration (a default date-time is used if none is guessed). After this, any changes to date-times in the Progress Bar will have no effect on the monitored activity/resource and vice-versa.</p>
