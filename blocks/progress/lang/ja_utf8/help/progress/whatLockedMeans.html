<h1>What does Locked to Deadline Mean?</h1>

<p>Where an activity can, in its own settings, have a deadline, and a deadline is set, it is optional to use the deadline of the activity, or to set another separate time used for the activity in the Progress Bar.</p>
<p>To lock the Progress Bar to an activity's deadline it must have deadline enabled and set. If the deadline is locked, changing the deadline in the activity's settings will automatically change the time associated with the activity in the Progress Bar.</p>
<p>When an activity is not locked to a deadline of the activity, changing the date and time in the Progress Bar settings will not affect the deadline of the activity.</p>
