<h1>What can be Monitored?</h1>

<p>At this stage, a Progress Bar block can be used to monitor an individual student's progress in the following set activities and resources.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assignments</li>
    <li>Forums</li>
    <li>Quizzes</li>
    <li>Choice activities</li>
    <li>Feedback surveys</li>
    <li>Resources, specifically...</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Text and HTML pages viewed, and</li>
        <li>Links to files or webpages clicked</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>The capability to view other activities is being added over time, so this list may not be comprehensive.</p>
<p>Monitored items must be visible to be shown in the progress bar. Hiding an activity or resource will hide the event in the progress bar.</p>
