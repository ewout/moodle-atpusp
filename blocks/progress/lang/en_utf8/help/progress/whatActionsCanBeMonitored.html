<p>Because different activities and resources are used differently, what is monitored for each module varies. For example, for assignments, submission can be monitored; quizzes can be monitored on attempt; forums can be monitored for student postings; choice activities can monitored for answering and viewing resources is monitored.</p>
<p>Some activities can have more than one activity associated with them. In such cases, you can select the appropriate activity for each instance of that activity.</p>
