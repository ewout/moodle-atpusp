<h1>What does Expected By Mean?</h1>

<p>The <em>expected by</em> date-time is when the related activity/resource is expected to be completed (viewed, sumbitted, posted-to, etc...).</p>

<p>If there is already a deadline associated with an activity, like an assignment deadline, this deadline can be used as the expected time for the event as long as the "Locked to Deadline" checkbox is checked. By unticking this checkbox an independant expected time can be created, and altering this will not affect the actual deadline of the activity.</p>

<p>When you first visit the configuration page for the Progress Bar, or if you create a new activity/resource and return to the configuration page, a guess will be made about the expected date-time for the activity/resource.
<ul>
    <li>For an activity with an existing deadline, this deadline will used.</li>
    <li>When there is no activity deadline, but the course format used is a weekly format, the end of the week (just before midnight Sunday) is assumed.</li>
    <li>For an activity/resource not used in a weekly course format, the end of the week (just before midnight next Sunday) is used.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Once an expected date-time is set, it is independant of any deadline or other information for that activity/resource.</p>
