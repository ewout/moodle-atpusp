<h1>Why Use Icons?</h1>

<p>You may wish to add tick and cross icons in the Progress Bar to make this block more visually accessible for students with colour-blindness.</p>
<p>It may also make the meaning of the block clearer if you believe colours are not intuitive, either for cultural or personal reasons.</p>
<p>The colours of the progress bar sections are only configurable at site level.</p>
