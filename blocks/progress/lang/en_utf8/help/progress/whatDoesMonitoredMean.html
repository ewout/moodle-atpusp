<h1>What does Monitored Mean?</h1>

<p>The purpose of this block is to encourage students to manage their time effectively. Each student can monitor their progress in completing the activies and resources you have created.
<?php
    helpbutton('whatCanBeMonitored',get_string('what_can_be_monitored','block_progress'),'block_progress');
?>
</p>
<p>On the configuration page you will see a list of all the modules that you have created which can be monitored by the Progress Bar block. The module will only be monitored and appear as a small block in the progress bar if a checkmark is placed next to the corresponding activity/resource.</p>
