<h1>Why Display/Hide the NOW indicator</h1>

<p>Not all course are focussed on completion of tasks by specific times. Some courses may have an open-enrollment, allowing students to enrol and complete when they can.</p>
<p>To use the Progess Bar as a tool in such courses, create "Expected by" dates in the far-future and set the "Use NOW" setting to No.</p>
