 - Fixed for some browser compatibility issues such as Safari. Problem is in selection.js where it reference listbox elements as selectedList.item(i). Safari doesn't support the "item" property and requires use of the "options" property, as in selectedList.options.item(i) or selectedList.options[i]. Thanks for Slobodan Jovcic pointed this out.
