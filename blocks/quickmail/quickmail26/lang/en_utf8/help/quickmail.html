<h2>Quickmail v2.5</h2>

<p>Quickmail v2.5 allows you to send a message to one or more recipients in the Potential Recipient(s) list.<br />
You can add recipients one at a time by selecting a name from the Potential Recipient(s) list and clicking the Add button.<br />
You can add multiple recipients at the same time using any of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>click and drag the cursor to select multiple recipients in sequential order</li> 
<li>hold the shift key and click to select multiple recipients in sequential order</li> 
<li>hold the control key (Windows) or command key (Macintosh) and click to select multiple recipients in non-sequential order</li>
</ul>

<p>This message will be sent immediately after you click the Send Email button, even to those Moodle users who have chosen to receive discussion forum messages in digest format (i.e., once per day). </p>

<p>Some of the new features in Quickmail v2.5 include:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can now limit your choices based on class role. For instance: If you only want ot send to students, click students in the drop down list above your sections and groups and only students will be selected</li>
<li>Chose email recipients based on group and section membership</li>
<li>You no longer MUST enter anything in the message area</li>
<li>Adding multiple attachments has been added to the system</li>
<li>You can now chose to receive sent mail receipts or not (The default is no)</li>
</ul>

<p>We have more planned for Quickmail v3, so please send feedback to <a href="mailto:elearning@lsu.edu">elearning@lsu.edu</a> for future enhancement requests.</p>
