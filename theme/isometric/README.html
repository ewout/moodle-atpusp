<h2>Isometric</h2>
<h4>A Modified Moodle theme by Mary Evans<br />
Based on a FREE CSS Template<br />
Created: August. 15, 2010<br />
License: GPL</h4>
<h4>Menu</h4>
<p>This theme uses a JavaScript drop-down menu system. To use this menu you must have JavaScrpt enabled in your web browser.</p>
<p>To login the user is presented with a login box in the header so that they can enter their username and password. Once logged in, the user is presented with three tabs. "Logout","My Courses" and "Update Profile" (these are only visible after login).</p>
<p>You can modify the links for the drop-down submenu list in mainmenu.php, which is commented so that you might understand the set up.</p>
<h4>Support</h4>
<p>This theme is offered as is, without guaranteed support. If you need help, you're always free to post your questions in the <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46">Moodle forums</a>.</p>
<h4>Thank You!</h4>
<p>My thanks for all the support I personally recieve in the Moodle forums, from the users and contributors, and developers around the
world. You have taught me much. Thank you all!</p>
